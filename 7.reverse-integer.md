# 7. Reverse Integer
## Topics: Modulus Math, Overflow/Underflow

This was a straightforward modulus math problem, grabbing digits and scaling
our previous result by powers of 10 to get the reversed number. The tricky part
was correctly checking for any overflow/underflow on relevant operations,
**before** they are done. This can be accomplished by setting up inequalities
to compare the result of the operation against the min/max value and
manipulating them such that the operation acts on the min/max value instead of
the variables potentially exceeding this bound.
