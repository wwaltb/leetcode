# 15. 3sum
## Topics: Array, Two Pointers, Sorting

This problem is a lot like two-sum, but it is much harder to solve using a hash
map. This is because you still need a double loop when hashing, and you need a
way to filter out duplicates. With this in mind, a two pointer approach is
efficient and intuitive:

First, sort the array from least to greatest. Then an outer loop fixes one
element and an inner loop moves two pointers together, starting at either end
(left end is past fixed element, right is at array size). If the three numbers
sum to a positive number, then you need smaller numbers, so you move the right
pointer down. If it is negative, you move the left pointer up. If it equals 0,
you found a solution so add it to the result, then move either pointer. To
avoid duplicates, simply move past any identical values to the one just checked
when adjusting the pointers. The outer loop goes until the fixed number is
positive, since three positive numbers cannot sum to 0. The inner loop goes
while the two pointers do not intersect.
