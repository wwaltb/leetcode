# 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree
## Topics: Binary Tree, Depth-First Search, Hash Map

This problem can be easily solved using DFS repeatedly, once to recover the
binary tree, and again whenever we search for a value. However, the solution
can be optimized significantly by hashing the values found during tree
recovery, and then simply searching this hash map to find values.
